[]  Needs to be done
[x] Done ;)

Code Cleanup To Do
[] Clean [/views] folder, remove deprecated views, and delete commented sections of the code
[] Clean [/public/javascripts] folder:
    [] Consolidate related functions into related .js files
    [] Remove deprecated functions and .js files
    [] Segregate .hbs files into a new folder, i.e: /public/hbs_templates
[] Clean [/public] folder. This folder has a lot of crap in it, much of it deprecated.
    [] Clean [/javascripts]
    [] Clean [/stylesheets]
    [] [/socket.io]?
    [] [/uploads]?
    [] [/lib]?
[] Clean [/controllers] folder.
    [] Consolidate controllers by function
    [] Clean "app.js" to reflect consolidated controllers
[] Standardize [/backend] and [/defaults] folder contents/
[] Clean [/Neptune] main directory
    [] "/backend_results", "data", "output" ; deprecated folders should be culled
[] Implement some user history
    [] Thoughts?
[] package.JSON should be updated to ensure simple npm-install
[] Local libraries and dependencies for neptune should be organized.
